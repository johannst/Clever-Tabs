" Script solving indentation problem. Main idea is
" have tabs ("\t") at the beginning of line and 
" after first another character like "\t" use spaces (like expandtab).
" This is useful for code readability. I'm trying to join these two ways:
" * http://www.movement.uklinux.net/docs/whytabs/
" * http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html
" with using the best ideas from both.
"
" main() {
"     printf("hello");    //my comment
"     printf("world!");   //my comment 2
" }
" 
" Before printf are tabs (this is block) anda before comments
" are tabs converted into spaces. After you change 
" tabstop (for tabelator size), part with comments will 
" have still same format, becuase tabs are only on line beginnig.
"
" note:    parameter for CleverTabs is shiftwidth in spaces
" note2:   this is my first script in vim, please be patient
"
" special thanks to james pickard for useful advices
